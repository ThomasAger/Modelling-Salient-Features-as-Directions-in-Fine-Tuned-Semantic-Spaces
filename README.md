This repository will contain an easy to use way to replicate the experiments in the paper "Modelling Salient Features as Directions in Fine Tuned Semantic Spaces". Currently a work in progress. Planned to be completed by the end of April 2019.
The repository used to produce the results in the paper is available, but it has not been cleaned: https://github.com/ThomasAger/Autoencoder-Explanations

We have made available some example direction scores and the spaces used in the paper here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v_W9Cj4DJqmb2gm0rjrjV-aipyfJSEax
